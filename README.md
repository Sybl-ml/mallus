# Mallus

`mallus` is a Python module that allows clients to connect to the Sybl service.

## Requirements

The requirements for `mallus` can be installed as follows:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, you can install `mallus` from the test variant of PyPI:
```bash
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ syblmallus --extra-index-url
https://pypi.org/simple/
```

## Getting Started

To begin working with `mallus` and running models as a client on Sybl, you
should first have both the `api-server` and `dcl` binaries executing from
`dodona`. Further instructions can then be found in the `guides/` directory in
the `dodona` repository, specifically the `become_a_client.md` and
`register_a_model.md` guides.
